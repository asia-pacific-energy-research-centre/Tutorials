# Tutorials
## Overview
This repository contains tutorials and examples of data cleaning and shaping, regressions, and more. These examples are from other repositories on GitHub. To use these, clone the repository to your computer and start a new branch.

1. Tidy Data - data used in the "Tidy Data" paper
2. Steel Industry Regression - example of regression using 7th Edition data for steel sector
3. Linear Regression Demo
4. Pandas Exercises
5. Gender Classification Challenge

### Tidy Data and Reproducability
Two important concepts we follow are:
1. Tidy Data [PDF](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
2. Reproducability [link](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510#pcbi-1005510-g001); [PDF](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510&type=printable)

Please see the docs folder for papers on both topics. The data from the Tidy Data paper is also available.

A Python Pandas cheat sheet is saved in the docs folder.

### Text Editor
A powerful text editor is _highly_ recommended.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can write and run Python and GAMS code. It even has a jupyter notebook so you can test your Python scripts without leaving the app (and without needing to open a web browser).
- Jupyter Notebook (included in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)). You can run Python in Visual Studio Code. Some files you will see are in .ipnyb format, which you'll need to open in your browser.
